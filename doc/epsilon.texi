@node This manual is incomplete
@chapter This manual is incomplete

This manual is @emph{very} incomplete, actually just a stub.  The
project needs actual documentation, and I plan to write it --- but not
before the implementation itself is in a stable state.

At the present time I'm using this document mostly to try out ideas,
for myself.  You're welcome to look if you're curious, but this is not
really ready for users.

As the document gradually converges to a stable state, the
presentation style will get richer, and I'll write English in a more
careful way.  I'm actually a perfectionist.  But I can't waste time on
my literary ambitions when I'm writing braindumps.


@section Where to look

Ironically, I've already written at length about epsilon.

I've described its formal syntax and semantics, along with its
philosophy and rationale, in my PhD thesis.  It's available at
@url{http://ageinghacker.net/publications#phd-thesis}, and you're very
welcome to read it.  Anyway, even if it also describes some source
code, a thesis is not software documentation.  The mathematical
treatment is not very accessible, and there is barely any mention of
the user interface.

Essentially, my thesis provides a formal treatment of epsilon, also
deriving some properties from its semantics, by formal proofs.  Such a
formal system is inherently fragile, and can't be kept correct unless
the language is frozen.  I don't plan any radical change
in @epsilonzero at the current time, but I might see some change to
make in the future.  This is definitely a @emph{The Right Thing} kind
of project, and if it turns out that I have to destroy in order to
build a better thing, I'm perfectly willing.  The thesis will stay as
it is: it covers my language philosophy and describes very precisely a
particular state in the language history.  At the present time, that
state is a strict subset of the current state, which makes the
description still very relevant.  In the future, this may change and
the software may drift away into a different direction.

I plan to use my blog to post updates about epsilon; again, mostly
thinking of myself as the public.  Blog posts will show ideas in a
less stable state than this document, and will also deal with failed
attempts.  The blog address is @url{http://ageinghacker.net/blog}

Of course you're welcome to write to the project mailing list (see
@url{http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/epsilon-devel}), or to
me personally if you have questions.

Thanks.

@c ==============================================================
@node Compilers
@chapter Compilers

Thanks to its architecture, compilers for epsilon are simply sets of
ordinary procedures, technically part of its library.  There is no
magic external program called a compiler: compilation is simply a
functionality available to program, which can decide at some point to
dump their state into a native executable file during their execution.

As a consequence of epsilon's architecture, its compilers are
whole-program.

At the present time I'm working on the @emph{trivial compiler}.  A more
ambitious compiler, likely using GCC as the middle-end, will come
later.

@c @section Trivial compiler
The trivial compiler is conceived to be very simple and easy to
retarget, while still generating code good enough to beat an interpreter
in performance.

As a slogan or design goal for the trivial compiler we could say
@emph{100,000 times smaller than GCC, only 10 times slower code}.  The
efficiency goal has not been attained yet.

A frontend translates @epsilonzero, to an intermediate stack-based
language.  Several different backends exist to translate the
intermediate code to either machine code, or to code for our custom
SVM virtual machine.

@section Frontend
@fixme{It works and it doesn't really need much maintaining, but is
currently the ugliest part of the compiler.  I'd like to rewrite
that.}

@section Intermediate language
The intermediate language has a very uniform behavior: parameters and
results are passed through a thread-local stack.  Each procedure
activation has a stack frame containing slots for input and output,
for local variables, and scratch space.  The exact stack layout is
specific to each backend.

Primitives may be implemented in portable C or in assembly.  In either
case, they operate on the stack, popping parameters off the top of the
stack, and pushing back results.  It is reasonable that a new backend
starts with all primitives implemented in C, with the user replacing
the most used ones with assembly implementations, for better performance.

At all moments the stack height relative to the currently procedure
frame is known at compilation time, which enables backends to
translate stack accesses into memory read and writes using a frame
pointer plus constant offsets, with no need for a stack pointer at run
time.

Such frame-pointer-relative operations are more efficient than the
naïve alternative, but all the reading, writing and copying of
intermediate data through memory (rather than registers) is the main
reason the trivial compiler generates inefficient code.

@fixme{Some} backends may use a second stack per thread to hold return
addresses and some temporaries which are only needed at procedure call
time; since everything on the main stack gets to be data, having such
a @emph{return stack} simplifies the garbage collection interface.  As
a secondary advantage, the return stack may be used for keeping some
temporaries which are only needed at call time, which saves some
shuffling on indirect calls.

The intermediate code distinguishes tail and non-tail calls.

@fixme{add an example}

@c @subsection Backend-dependant runtime

@section Backends

@subsection The Slow Virtual Machine
@fixme{The SVM exists, but it was conceived for a previous iteration
of the architecture.  I have to adapt it a little, which will result in
simpler code, and likely in better performance as well.}

@subsection C backend
This was actually the first backend I wrote.  It works, but I don't
think it will scale to large programs (even if people tell me that
recent GCCs are very good at compiling huge C source files made of
small function, which is my case).  More importantly, the problem of
sibling-call compilation is entirely delegated to GCC.

@fixme{I will replace this with the SVM}

@subsection MIPS backend
@fixme{This already generates working code, even if the interface is kinda ugly}

@subsubsection Register map
We use registers which are callee-save according to C ABIs:
@code{$16}-@code{$23}.  They should be plenty.

I don't reserve for our internal purposes the registers used for
passing parameters (@code{$4}-@code{$7} on the o32 ABI,
@code{$4}-@code{$11} on n32 and n64) or returning results
(@code{$2}-@code{$3}) in C, nor C the stack pointer @code{$29} or the
global pointer @code{$28}.

The global pointer @code{$29} can be trashed by C functions under the
o32 ABI.  All the more recent ABIs have since fixed that, but o32 is
still widespread.  I currently restore @code{$29} after calling C
functions, without conditionalizing on the ABI.

@table @code
@item $2-$3
scratch
@item $16
epsilon stack pointer
@item $21
a valid copy of the global pointer, to restore @code{$29}
@item $22
@code{epsilon_c_primitive_functions} base.
@item $23
pointer to the C @code{struct thread_context} structure for the current thread.
@end table
Easily available for future use:
@table @code
@item $17-$20
available for future use
@item $12-$15
(caller-save) available as scratch for future use
@item $24-$25
(caller-save) available as scratch for future use
@end table

@subsection x86_64 backend
There are two completely different calling conventions.  If I also have to support the microsoft convention, I will have to conditionalize a little.

@table @emph
@item GNU (actually system V, also used by the other Unix systems)
parameters @code{%rdi}, @code{%rsi}, @code{%rdx}, @code{%rcx}, @code{%r8}, and @code{%r9} --- results @code{%rax}, @code{%rdx}
@item microsoft
parameters @code{%rcx}, @code{%rdx}, @code{%r8}, @code{%r9} --- result @code{%rax}
@end table
I'll completely ignore the microsoft convention for the time being.

Again, I'm only reserving callee-save registers.
In the SysV ABI, callee-save registers are
@code{%rbx}, @code{%r12}, @code{%r13}, @code{%r14}, @code{%r15}.
@code{%rsp} is also technically callee-save, but I don't want to use it.  The same holds for @code{%rbp}; that should be less critical, but I still won't use it.

So, here's my tentative register map for the SysV ABI:
@table @code
@item %rax %r11
scratch
@item %rbx
epsilon stack pointer
@item %r12
@code{epsilon_c_primitive_functions} base.
@item %r13
pointer to the C @code{struct thread_context} structure for the current thread.
@end table

Easily available for future use:
@table @code
@item %r14 %r15
available for future use
@end table

I use the C stack for return addresses, and for return addresses only.
This comes for free when using @code{callq}, which pushes a return
address to @code{%rsp}.

@subsection Future backends
@fixme{I plan to write a backends for PowerPC and x86 as well.  I
don't have access to hardware implementations of other architectures at
the present time, but I know where to ask when the time comes.}
